# Notes
* Start with "so, you are getting ready to submit your paper..."
* Exercise: Catalog the things you have from the workshop
  * where do they currently live?
  * what needs to be published?
  * how many are already published?
* What still needs to happen?
  * Published need not mean archived: availability and access for
    perpetuity.
  * Published need not mean easily citable, and easily trackable for
    impact: acquire persistent identifier that is broadly supported in
    scholarly communication. 
* How to structure discussion to avoid "now, let's talk about everything related to publication?"
